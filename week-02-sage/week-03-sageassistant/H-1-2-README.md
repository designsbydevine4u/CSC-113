# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
The way I am understanding it is that SAGE is a bot built in AI that will be helpful to me in learning whatever subject I need help with and to assist me with my assignments. It would be my "encyclopedia" when I do not know where or how to find information.

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
1. To find information that I can't find.
2. To be the quick search for a conglomerate of information that would take me a long time to find myself.
3. To help me understand direction and lead me to fulfilling my assignments.
4. To help get my unstuck when I have no clue what I'm doing.

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: Gemini because I'm familiar with Google.
- **Secondary**: ChapGPT because I already use this one.
- **For Special Tasks**: This will be based on each instance.

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
1. I will never ask AI to do my assignments for me.
2. I will only ask for guidance or a nudge when stuck.
3. I will keep in mind that my work still has to be original so if AI is doing to much, I have to identify rules to keep from crossing lines.
